- Wes Bos 30-day challenge - Day 11 [done]

## Commentary

Really enjoyed day 11 of the challenge today.  I had no idea how robust HTML5â€™s video playback implementation is.  It is very easy to hook into with javascript and with custom styles.  Really can see just how much potential it all has and why most players have moved to HTML5 implementations.
