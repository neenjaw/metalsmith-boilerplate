- Wes Bos 30-day challenge - day 16

## Commentary

Made use of the destructuring assignment today in the wes bos challenge (MDN: JS ES 6 - Destructuring Assignment) It is really so neat to see how useful all the new features in ES6 are when doing regular work.  I took the example and adapted it further to use css variables for the manipulations rather than coding the style changes in javascript.  CSS variables are just so powerful.
