# Jan 21

- Look at the next section of the udemy course, lecture 258/259 to learn about mongoose.
- How to add it to a node app
- How to make a schema
- How to make a model
- How to make a schema + model at once
- How to add save, find, create entries.

## Commentary

The mongoose ODM seems very useful in creating a consistent application.  I think one of the frustrations Iâ€™ve run in to with PHP interacting with databases is that it is very easy to become inconsistent with your interface and how you interact with the database.
